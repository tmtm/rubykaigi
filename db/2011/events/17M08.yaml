  en: "Advancing Net::HTTP"
  ja:
abstract:
  en: "Net::HTTP is a great Ruby HTTP library. In this talk, I will cover some improvements I have made to Net::HTTP in order to add support for nonblocking reads, even in HTTP requests that use gzip, Transfer-Encoding: Chunked and keepalive.

I will also talk about how nonblocking IO and network libraries can be used with a pure-Ruby reactor to enable scoped parallel IO in a single thread, and how we can improve existing Ruby network libraries to enable async operation."
